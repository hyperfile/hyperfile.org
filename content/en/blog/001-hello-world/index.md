During the May 2024 holiday, the first line of code for the Hyperfile project was written. Over more than a year of continuous exploration and several refactoring iterations, the project finally went public in September 2025.

Looking back at the two main visions when the project began:

1. Validate the concept and technical approach of performing **file operations directly on S3**
2. Mastering [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) through a medium-scale project with advanced usage patterns

Both of these initial goals have been achieved.

Iteration is the life of software, [v0.2.0](https://github.com/hyperfile/hyperfile/releases/tag/v0.2.0) is the first version of Hyperfile to go public.

To let the project to go further, I decided to open source this project.

Through open sourcing, transform the driving force of project iteration from personal interest to community needs.

Of course, open sourcing is just the first little step. The current codes need to be improved, and many features are still under development. I will continue to move forward through continuous iteration.
