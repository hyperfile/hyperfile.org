### How do I use it

Currently Hyperfile ONLY provides API as Rust library and needs to be integrated into application code for use.

While we still improve the documantations, you can refer to [examples](https://github.com/hyperfile/hyperfile/tree/main/examples) for real usage.

### How to contact

Any good ideas and suggestions please goes to [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/hyperfile/discussions) section.
